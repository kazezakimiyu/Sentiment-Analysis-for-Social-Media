Note: due to the large size of our dataset, please download dataset from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140?resource=download, and put it OUTSIDE of the Sentiment-Analysis-for-Social-Media folder. Thanks for understanding!

Instruction for python files: each python file with model name on it (bayes.py, LSTM.py, logistic.py) contains all the steps needed for the model to be trained, and by running the files itself can get the learning curves of that model, we have also added screenshots of the learning curves in the folder if you want to save time (Note: LSTM.py runs a very long time, if you only want to see the result, we have provided a screenshot of the accuracy and other data as well called LSTM.JPG)

The predict.py is built based on the model from LSTM.py, if you want to try the small prediction app we created you can run predict.py directly, as the model generated from last time is being kept(sentiment_lstm_model)

Thank you for your time!
